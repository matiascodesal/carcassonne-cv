Image Naming Scheme

<Tile Functional Type>_<Tile Art Variant>_<Photograph Instance>
Tile Function Type: A letter from A-X which corresponds with the mapping from Appendix A of this thesis:
https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/MasterThesisCarcassonne.pdf

Tile Art Variant: Can just be a slight difference in art for the same functional tile due to art direction or differing game edition.

Photograph Instance: Used to enumerate the various images of the same functional type and same art variant.  We want the same tile in a variety of different lighting conditions, distances, angles, blurriness, etc. to train the CV.
